            <p>This is a website that makes it easier to deal with social workers</p>
            <p>Enter in your information once, download it into one simple file, and never have to explain yourself over and over ever again!</p>
            <p>To start, simply make an account by clicking the signup button.</p>
            <p>Once you've signed up and logged in, you'll be brought to your home page. There, you can answer some common questions asked by social workers by clicking the "edit" button, and then download a list of all your answers by clicking the "download" button at the bottom of the page.</p>
            <p>Happy Writing!</p>
